# If you only want a workers.dev URL (no custom domain), keep this file as-is.
# After deploy, Wrangler will print a URL like:
# https://stjohn-contact.<yourname>.workers.dev

# If later you want to bind a route on your own domain, add:
# routes = [
#   { pattern = "contact.yourdomain.com/*", zone_name = "yourdomain.com" }
# ]
