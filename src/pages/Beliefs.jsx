          As a Church of God in Christ congregation, we affirm the statement of
          faith that is rooted in the Word of God and aligned with the historic

          <li>We believe the Bible to be the inspired and only infallible written Word of God.</li>
          <li>There is only One God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</li>
          <li>The blessed Hope is the rapture of the Church of God in Christ at His return.</li>
          <li>Cleansing from sin comes through repentance and faith in the precious Blood of Jesus Christ.</li>
          <li>Regeneration by the Holy Ghost is absolutely essential for personal salvation.</li>
          <li>Christâ€™s redemptive work on the Cross provides healing for the human body in answer to believing prayer.</li>
          <li>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:4) is given to believers who ask for it.</li>
